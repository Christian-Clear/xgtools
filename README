================================================================================

Xgtools is a collection of tools for manipulating FTS and XGremlin line lists
and data files and is released under the GNU General Public License version 3. 
Please read COPYING for details. The package includes several programs:

extractlevel : Extracts lines from a Kurucz gf*.lines file based on the energy
               of a target upper or lower level.
ftscalibrate : Calibrates the wavenumbers of lines saved in an XGremlin ASCII 
               (writelines) line list.
ftscombine   : Combines several spectral .dat files using + - x or / operators
ftsintensity : Calibrates the intensity of an FTS line spectrum.
ftsresponse  : Calculates a spectrometer response function.
generatesyn  : Generates an XGremlin SYN file from a Kurucz line list.
xgcatlin     : Concatenates several XGremlin line list (.LIN) files.
xgfit        : Automates line fitting in XGremlin with lsqfit.
xgsave       : Converts XGremlin scratch spectra into externally readable files.

Many of these programs require the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), so make sure
that the development files for GSL have been installed before compiling Xgtools.
To compile Xgtools, just use the standard commands:

./configure
make
sudo make install
